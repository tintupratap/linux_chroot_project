some systems miss these groups and show errors but you can safely ignore them anyway since we have a workaround with mtab, hosts and resolv.conf:
systemd-journal-remote(remote filesystem)
audio
disk
kvm
systemd-journal
systemd-network
utmp
users

If there are other errors, let me know by pull request..
